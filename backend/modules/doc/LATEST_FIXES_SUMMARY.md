# Luna Project - Issue Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. ✅ Gemini API Key Management
- **Issue**: Users were asked to put Gemini API key but there was no clear way to manage it
- **Solution**: 
  - Added "AI Settings" tab to Profile page (`/profile`)
  - Shows connection status (Connected/Not Connected) 
  - Provides clear instructions on how to get Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
  - Allows users to save, view (masked), and remove API keys
  - Keys are stored locally in browser (localStorage)
  - Updated error message in ResultCard to direct users to Profile > AI Settings

### 2. ✅ Comprehensive Analysis Image in Results
- **Issue**: The comprehensive_analysis.png was not showing in results
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed mapping in `luna_processor.py` to correctly upload comprehensive_analysis.png to Cloudinary
  - Moved comprehensive_analysis.png from viz_mapping to analysis_mapping 
  - Updated file path to use output_dir where the image is actually created
  - Added comprehensive analysis visualization to ResultCard in visualizations tab

### 3. ✅ Dashboard View and Download Fixes
- **Issue**: Dashboard view button redirected incorrectly and download didn't work like results section
- **Solution**:
  - Changed view button to navigate to `/results` instead of `/results/{job_id}`
  - Added `downloadAllImagesFromResult()` function to dashboard
  - Download button now downloads all images (original, visualization, analysis, slope, aspect, hillshade, contour, quality report)
  - Implements same staggered download logic as ResultCard

### 4. ✅ Real-time Processing Status Updates
- **Issue**: Processing status stuck at 10% and not updating in real-time
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced polling mechanism in `Processing.tsx`
  - Added debug logging to track status updates
  - Improved progress calculation (queued: 5%, processing: actual progress value)
  - Fixed polling logic to continue until completion or max attempts
  - Status updates every 2 seconds with proper error handling

## Technical Implementation Details:

### Profile Page Updates:
- Added AI Settings tab with 4-column layout

- Step-by-step instructions for obtaining API key
- Benefits section explaining AI features

### Backend Processing Updates:
- Fixed comprehensive_analysis.png upload path in CloudinaryService
- Proper file mapping in luna_processor.py
- Status updates with incremental progress (10% → 20% → 30% → 50% → 60% → 70% → 80% → 90% → 95% → 100%)

### Frontend Enhancements:
