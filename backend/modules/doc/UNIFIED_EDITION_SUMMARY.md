- **Automatic workflow** from image detection to final analysis

### 2. Multi-Format Image Support
- **Auto-detection** of PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF formats
- **Prioritization system** for optimal image selection
- **Compatibility testing** for all detected images
- **Robust error handling** for various image formats and bit depths

### 3. Comprehensive Processing Pipeline
- **Image preprocessing** with normalization and validation
- **Optimized SfS algorithm** with adaptive regularization
- **Bilateral filtering** for edge-preserving smoothing
- **Physical scaling** to real-world coordinates
- **Multi-format output** generation

### 4. Quality Assessment System
- **Automated scoring** (0-100 scale) for DEM quality
- **Statistical analysis** of height distributions
- **Gradient and roughness** analysis
- **Correlation metrics** with input imagery
- **Detailed reporting** in human-readable format

### 5. Output Management
- **Automatic cleanup** of previous outputs
- **Organized file structure** with separate output and analysis directories
- **Multiple output formats**: GeoTIFF, OBJ, PNG visualizations
- **File size tracking** and comprehensive result summary

## Usage

### Simple Execution
```bash
# Place images in data/ directory
python luna_unified.py
```

### What Happens
1. **Setup**: Cleans previous outputs, creates fresh directories
2. **Detection**: Finds all supported image formats in data/
3. **Testing**: Tests compatibility of all found images
4. **Selection**: Automatically selects best image for processing
5. **Processing**: Runs optimized SfS algorithm with progress tracking
6. **Output**: Generates GeoTIFF, OBJ, and visualization files
7. **Analysis**: Performs quality assessment and scoring
8. **Summary**: Reports all results with file sizes and locations

### Outputs Generated
- **GeoTIFF DEM**: Georeferenced elevation model
- **OBJ 3D Model**: For visualization in 3D software
- **PNG Visualizations**: 2D and 3D plots of results
- **Quality Report**: Comprehensive analysis and scoring
- **Processing History**: Algorithm convergence and optimization plots

## Performance

- **Processing Time**: 30-300 seconds (depends on image size)
- **Memory Usage**: ~2-4x image size in RAM
- **Supported Resolutions**: 512x512 to 16,000x16,000+ pixels
- **Output Quality**: Automated 0-100 scoring system
- **File Sizes**: GeoTIFF (50-100MB), OBJ (500MB-2GB)
